      <title>My first foss4g experience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I embarked on a journey to attend the esteemed geospatial conference, foss4g 2023, held in Prizren. As I reflect, it was an event that left a profound impact on me, and I want to treasure these memories forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Day1: Entering the Exhibition center at ITP, Prizren&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of months ago, I had my doubts about attending foss4g, as I had never traveled to a foreign country before. The logistics to get visa and planning the round-trip seemed daunting, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if it would be worth the investment and energy. However, to my delight, I discovered that there were other indians planning their travel too, making the planning process much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there I was, hopping on the plane to Pristina, Kosovo, and thinking to myself, &amp;ldquo;Did I really make the right call by shelling out a ton of money for this conference?&amp;rdquo; But, looking back now, I have to say, it was totally worth it! All the energy and effort I put into being a part of this event, it paid off big time. I&amp;rsquo;m filled with a sense of contentment right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at foss4g, I got to hang out with the cool, nerdy core developers, organizers, and users of geospatial technology.  I made some awesome new friends and dove headfirst into the wild nightlife of that stunning city. The experience was overwhelming, and it demanded an extra surge of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption align = &#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Day5: Presenting my work to a room full of geonerds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was this my first foss4g, but also the first time I presented my work. I was thrilled to receive positive feedback after my talk and to connect with individuals who shared my passion and interests. It was like finding my tribe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ten days in Kosovo were one of the most remarkable days of my life. The people I met, both from Kosovo and Albania, made me feel right at home and added to the incredible experience. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back home, I have a fresh perspective, a bunch of goals to accomplish, and a trove of memories that I will cherish forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am immensely grateful to foss4g, the people of Kosovo, and the organizers who made this extraordinary event possible. I hope to have the opportunity to attend again next year and reunite with the friends I made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you foss4g, the people of Kosovo and to the organizers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed, hope to meet again next year at Brazil!&lt;/p&gt;
